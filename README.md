# er-ant-lints
My own collection of lint rules

There are separated by comments areas in lint files. Also I have added explanation comments inside.

- Basic rules - basic rules, strictly avoid to change it
- Advanced rules - more "difficult" rules and cases from development
- Different areas rules - groupped rules by language functionality (promises, localization, signals and etc.)
- Disputable rules - rules which can be disputable and they are very subjective. Feel free to change them for your taste
- Configurable individual rules - rules which would be good to configure for your project individually. For example class names and etc.
